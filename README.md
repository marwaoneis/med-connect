> MedConnect is an application designed to benefit patients, doctors, and healthcare providers. Patients enjoy convenience with features like virtual consultations, an AI-assisted symptom checker, and automated medication reminders. Doctors benefit from more efficient workflows and improved communication. Hospitals and medical centers witness increased administrative efficiency, leading to an overall enhancement of patient care effectiveness.

### User Stories

- As a user seeking health information, I want to interact with the ChatBot to receive accurate and helpful responses to basic health queries, so I can make precise decisions about my health.
- As a doctor, I want to conduct virtual consultations with patients through the Tele-medicine feature, so I can provide a flexible and efficient way to deliver healthcare services.
- As a pharmacy, I want to seamlessly integrate with the app to receive electronic prescriptions and coordinate efficiently with healthcare providers, so I can ensure accurate and timely medication dispensing.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### MedConnect is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
