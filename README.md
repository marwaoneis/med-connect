<!-- Prototyping -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

> We designed MedConnect using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
> The database structure was first drafted in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for basic planning, then refined with detailed designs and animations in Figma.

### MedConnect is built using the following technologies:

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.

- The app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)for the backend. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allow running JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. Using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) which is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

- For trusted database foundation, the app uses the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) that enables you to work with data the way you want â€“ easily and effortlessly.

- For notifications, the app uses [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) which is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably deliver messages at no cost.
