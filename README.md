### MedConnect is built using a combination of modern technologies. Below is an overview of the key technologies employed in the development of MedConnect.

- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a versatile and powerful cross-platform framework that allows us to develop MedConnect with a single codebase for both mobile and web platforms.
- **Language**: [Dart](https://dart.dev/) is used as the primary programming language, complementing Flutter for a smooth and responsive UI.
- **Platform**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for real-time chatting features are powered by Firebase. We are currently working on integrating Firebase for robust and efficient push notifications.
- **Technology**: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Its purpose is utilized for its efficient handling of asynchronous events and high throughput, which powers the server-side of MedConnect.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) used for its flexible data storage capabilities, aiding in the efficient management and retrieval of data.
- **Framework**: [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is integrated as a back-end web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the server-side logic and routing for MedConnect.

> ðŸš¨ **Note**:I am actively working on refining the notification system for an improved user experience.

MedConnect employs material design principles for its UI, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The primary font used is tailored to ensure readability and visual appeal.

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

### Enhancing AI Capabilities with Google Gemini and Prompt Engineering:

- This project leverages the sophisticated capabilities of Google Gemini in AI implementation, significantly enhancing our interaction with natural language processing models. By employing refined prompt engineering strategies, we have customized the AI's responsiveness to understand and generate language more precisely and efficiently for diverse tasks. A key feature developed using this approach is our symptom checker. This intuitive tool patiently waits for users to describe their health symptoms or feelings. Upon receiving this input, the AI analyzes it to suggest potential causes, offer recommendations, and even identify suitable specialists for consultation. Below is a screenshot demonstrating the specific prompt used to achieve this functionality.
